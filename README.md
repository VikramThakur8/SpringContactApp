# SpringContactApp
The is part of my Spring Web MVC Framework - "Project Work Series"
The project "SpringContactApp" is discussed step by step on my YouTube channel.
Its complete, step-by-step and industry standard.

# MOTIVATION
Writing small-small sample example is different than developing a complete project. 
That's why I planned to develop a small but complete project to cover up the best practices of software development and modular approaches used by experts for production grade enterprise application.

This project covered many concepts like DAO, Services, Business Logic, Controller, Loose Coupling, Modular Development, Unit Testing, Modular View, User Login-Logout, Session Handing, CRUD Operation, Connection Pool(DataSource), JSTL taglib, JSP View, Message error/success and many more. Do not skip or miss any video, just follow step by step videos.
Also download the source code from this reposotory "SpringContactApp". 
Good Luck
